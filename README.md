# randomizer

A randomizer library for producing mock data.
Allows dozens of ways to randomize numbers, strings, words,
sentences, and dates. Includes tiny libraries of the most
commonly used words (in order), the most commonly used letters
(in order) and personal names that can be used as first or last.
For making sentences, "wurds" are used - words with scrambled vowels
so they aren't actual words, but look more like lorem ipsum. Change the
property real to true to use "words" instead of "wurds" (it can
also produce humorous results).
